# Happy Teams!
## Why another CRM and Project Planning Tool?
The goal of this project is to provide a basic CRM tool, include resource/project planning, with a twist.  In addition to ensuring that a project has proper resource allocation and resources have full coverage, we want our teams to be happy!  I was inspired to develop this project when I realized that some members of my team were working on contracts that fell below what I would call an "enjoyment threshold."  As we all know, people do their best work when they are enjoying what they are doing, so, why not provide insight into this mysterious "enjoyment factor" while doing project planning?

## Install
1. Clone this repo.
2. Setup a virtualenv and install the pip requirements.  You can remvoe the ipython requirement, I just find that interactive interface way preferable since much of the functionality currently exists just at the shell level.
3. I suggest you run the populate_skill_enjoyment_levels command to provide some fixture data for the SkillEnjoyment model.  This is just a recommended starting point.

## Usage
more to come.
